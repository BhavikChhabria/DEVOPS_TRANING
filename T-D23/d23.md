1. Define the Architecture
Components Required:

    Application Load Balancer (ALB): Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances to ensure even load distribution and high availability.
    EC2 Instances: Serve as the application servers handling the business logic and user requests.
    RDS Instance: Acts as the database tier to store and manage application data.

Expected Traffic:

    Concurrent Users: Up to 100,000 users.

Choosing Appropriate EC2 and RDS Configurations:

    EC2 Instance Types:
        For a scalable solution, we'll need to balance between performance and cost. t3.medium instances provide a good starting point for a moderate load. For higher concurrency, consider larger instance types or additional instances.
        Example Selection: Start with t3.medium instances (2 vCPUs, 4 GiB RAM). alt text



    RDS Configuration:
        db.m5.large instance is a good start (2 vCPUs, 8 GiB RAM). Adjust based on database performance requirements.
        Storage: Consider using General Purpose (SSD) for moderate I/O performance and cost-efficiency.

2. Select AWS Services
Application Load Balancer (ALB):

    Cost Considerations: Based on the number of requests and data processed.

EC2 Instances:

    Type: t3.medium
    Number: Start with an estimated number based on load testing. For high availability, consider at least 2 instances.

RDS Instance:

    Type: db.m5.large
    Storage: Start with 100 GiB of General Purpose (SSD).

3. Estimate Costs Using AWS Pricing Calculator

Navigate to the AWS Pricing Calculator and add the components:
Application Load Balancer:

    Monthly Cost: Includes the fixed hourly rate and per GB processed.

EC2 Instances:

    t3.medium:
        On-Demand Pricing: Check current pricing on the AWS Pricing Calculator.
        Example Cost: As of the latest data, it's approximately $0.0376 per hour.

    Number of Instances: Start with 2 instances.

RDS Instance:

    db.m5.large:
        On-Demand Pricing: Check current pricing on the AWS Pricing Calculator.
        Example Cost: As of the latest data, it's approximately $0.096 per hour.

    Storage:
        100 GiB General Purpose (SSD): Cost based on the per GiB rate.

### **Comprehensive AWS S3 Management and Static Website Hosting**

#### **Objective:**

To test your knowledge and skills in managing AWS S3 storage classes, lifecycle management, bucket policies, access control lists (ACLs), and hosting a static website on S3. You will apply their understanding in a practical scenario, ensuring you have mastered the critical aspects of AWS S3.

#### **Project Scenario:**

You are tasked with creating and managing an S3 bucket for a fictional company, "TechVista Inc.," that hosts a static website for displaying their product portfolio. The website will have different types of content, including high-resolution images, which require careful storage management to optimize costs. Additionally, the company has strict security requirements for accessing the content.

#### **Project Steps and Deliverables:**

1. **Create and Configure an S3 Bucket:**  
   * Create an S3 bucket named `techvista-portfolio-[your-initials]`.  
   * Enable versioning on the bucket.  
   * Set up the bucket for static website hosting.  
   * Upload the provided static website files (HTML, CSS, images).  
   * Ensure the website is accessible via the S3 website URL.  
2. **Implement S3 Storage Classes:**  
   * Classify the uploaded content into different S3 storage classes (e.g., Standard, Intelligent-Tiering, Glacier).  
   * Justify your choice of storage class for each type of content (e.g., HTML/CSS files vs. images).  
3. **Lifecycle Management:**  
   * Create a lifecycle policy that transitions older versions of objects to a more cost-effective storage class (e.g., Standard to Glacier).  
   * Set up a policy to delete non-current versions of objects after 90 days.  
   * Verify that the lifecycle rules are correctly applied.  
4. **Configure Bucket Policies and ACLs:**  
   * Create and attach a bucket policy that allows read access to everyone for the static website content.  
   * Restrict access to the S3 management console for specific IAM users using the bucket policy.  
   * Set up an ACL to allow a specific external user access to only a particular folder within the bucket.  
5. **Test and Validate the Configuration:**  
   * Test the static website URL to ensure it is accessible.  
   * Validate the storage class transitions based on the lifecycle policy.  
   * Check the effectiveness of the bucket policy and ACLs by simulating different access scenarios (e.g., accessing the content with an external user, denying access from unauthorized users).  
6. **Documentation and Report:**  
   * Document each step you performed, including the reasoning behind your choices for storage classes, lifecycle policies, bucket policies, and ACLs.  
   * Provide screenshots of key configurations and test results.  
   * Summarize the project in a brief report, highlighting any challenges faced and how they were resolved.

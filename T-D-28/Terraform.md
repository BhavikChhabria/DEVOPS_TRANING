#### **Project Objective:**

This project will assess your ability to deploy a multi-tier architecture application on AWS using Terraform. The deployment will involve using Terraform variables, outputs, and change sets. The multi-tier architecture will include an EC2 instance, an RDS MySQL DB instance, and an S3 bucket.

#### **Project Overview:**

You are required to write Terraform configuration files to automate the deployment of a multi-tier application on AWS. The architecture should consist of:

1. **EC2 Instance**: A `t2.micro` instance serving as the application server.  
2. **RDS MySQL DB Instance**: A `t3.micro` instance for the database backend.  
3. **S3 Bucket**: For storing static assets or configuration files.

#### **Specifications:**

* **EC2 Instance**: Use the `t2.micro` instance type with a public IP, allowing HTTP and SSH access.  
* **RDS MySQL DB Instance**: Use the `t3.micro` instance type with a publicly accessible endpoint.  
* **S3 Bucket**: Use for storing static assets, configuration files, or backups.  
* **Terraform Configuration**:  
  * Utilize Terraform variables to parameterize the deployment (e.g., instance type, database name).  
  * Use Terraform outputs to display important information (e.g., EC2 public IP, RDS endpoint).  
  * Implement change sets to demonstrate how Terraform manages infrastructure changes.  
* **No Terraform Modules**: Focus solely on the core Terraform configurations without custom or external modules.

#### **Key Tasks:**

1. **Setup Terraform Configuration:**  
   * **Provider Configuration**:  
     * Configure the AWS provider to specify the region for deployment.  
     * Ensure the region is parameterized using a Terraform variable.  
   * **VPC and Security Groups**:  
     * Create a VPC with a public subnet for the EC2 instance.  
     * Define security groups allowing HTTP and SSH access to the EC2 instance, and MySQL access to the RDS instance.  
   * **EC2 Instance**:  
     * Define the EC2 instance using a `t2.micro` instance type.  
     * Configure the instance to allow SSH and HTTP access.  
     * Use Terraform variables to define instance parameters like AMI ID and instance type.  
   * **RDS MySQL DB Instance**:  
     * Create a `t3.micro` MySQL DB instance within the same VPC.  
     * Use Terraform variables to define DB parameters like DB name, username, and password.  
     * Ensure the DB instance is publicly accessible, and configure security groups to allow access from the EC2 instance.  
   * **S3 Bucket**:  
     * Create an S3 bucket for storing static files or configurations.  
     * Allow the EC2 instance to access the S3 bucket by assigning the appropriate IAM role and policy.  
   * **Outputs**:  
     * Define Terraform outputs to display the EC2 instance’s public IP address, the RDS instance’s endpoint, and the S3 bucket name.  
2. **Apply and Manage Infrastructure:**  
   * **Initial Deployment**:  
     * Run `terraform init` to initialize the configuration.  
     * Use `terraform plan` to review the infrastructure changes before applying.  
     * Deploy the infrastructure using `terraform apply`, and ensure that the application server, database, and S3 bucket are set up correctly.  
   * **Change Sets**:  
     * Make a minor change in the Terraform configuration, such as modifying an EC2 instance tag or changing an S3 bucket policy.  
     * Use `terraform plan` to generate a change set, showing what will be modified.  
     * Apply the change set using `terraform apply` and observe how Terraform updates the infrastructure without disrupting existing resources.  
3. **Testing and Validation:**  
   * Validate the setup by:  
     * Accessing the EC2 instance via SSH and HTTP.  
     * Connecting to the MySQL DB instance from the EC2 instance.  
     * Verifying that the EC2 instance can read and write to the S3 bucket.  
   * Check the Terraform outputs to ensure they correctly display the relevant information.  
4. **Resource Termination:**  
   * Once the deployment is complete and validated, run `terraform destroy` to tear down all the resources created by Terraform.  
   * Confirm that all AWS resources (EC2 instance, RDS DB, S3 bucket, VPC) are properly deleted.  
5. **Documentation:**  
   * Document the entire process, including Terraform configurations, the purpose of each Terraform file, variables used, and outputs.  
   * Include screenshots or logs demonstrating the deployment, testing, and destruction of the resources.

#### **Deliverables:**

* **Terraform Configuration Files**: All `.tf` files used in the deployment.  
* **Deployment Documentation**: Detailed documentation covering the setup, deployment, change management, and teardown processes.  
* **Test Results**: Evidence of successful deployment and testing, including screenshots or command outputs.  
* **Cleanup Confirmation**: Confirmation that all resources have been terminated using `terraform destroy`.
